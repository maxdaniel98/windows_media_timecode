# Windows Media Timecode
> Windows Media Controls as MIDI MTC Timecode!


## Description 
This software monitors the Windows Media Controls for song playback, and outputs the current position of a song as MIDI MTC Timecode. It is also possible to set offsets for specific songs, or disable outputting of MIDI for songs that are not in the config. 

## Download
Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/maxdaniel98/windows_media_timecode/releases/latest). 

## Config
You should provide a `config.json` file in the working directory of the program, or start the software with an config file as argument, for example `windows_media_timecode.exe config-1.json`. 

This is a config example:

```{
  "midiDevice": "loopmidi",
  "disableSongsOutsideConfig": true,
  "songs": [
    {
      "artist": "Sam Smith",
      "title": "Unholy (feat. Kim Petras) - David Guetta Acid Remix",
      "timecodeOffset": 1200000
    },
	{
      "artist": "Gustaph",
      "title": "Because Of You",
      "timecodeOffset": 1800000
    },
	{
      "artist": "WALK THE MOON",
      "title": "Different Colors",
      "timecodeOffset": 0
    },
	{
      "artist": "Da√∞i Freyr",
      "title": "Whole Again",
      "timecodeOffset": 600000
    }
  ]
}
```
